# Sizzle (Extension)

## Install
- Google Chrome Webstore
- Mozilla Firefox Addons
- Microsoft Edge Addons

## Build
If you wanna build the extension from start, you can easily do that.

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build extension
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
3. Optional: Remove wasm file, reduces final bundle size.
   ```sh
   rm "dist/assets/ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep-<id>.wasm"
   ```
   You will need to find the wasm file manually as bundler generates a different id every time.
